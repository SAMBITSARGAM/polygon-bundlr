## Inspiration
As the Hackathon Requirement :
* Allow the user to login with their Polygon wallet.
* Use bundlr  network to allow users to deploy content with their MATIC tokens.
* Use of specific tags for the transaction, this will allow you to grab these transactions.
* Show the submitted transactions to the end user.
After that we planed what to do ! and how to do!

## Statement by Polygon
Traditional centralized data storage is the cornerstone of Web 2.0 and a huge industry. A number of projects including FileCoin, Storj and Sia have sprung up to develop a crypto-native pay-as-you-go storage alternative. What sets Arweave apart is that its users pay a one-time upfront fee to store the data in perpetuity, a feat made possible with a new economic model that incentivizes miners to replicate data and blockchain innovations such as Blockweave and Proof of Access.

## What it does
Basically this is a react-typescript based web-application that allow user to upload text and documents to the Arweave through the bundlr network using the matic (polygon) token.

## What is polygon ?
* Polygon is a secondary scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. 
* These types of solutions work on top of an existing blockchain network rather than using their own blockchain. 
* In this instance, Polygon works on top of Ethereum which has become slow and expensive to use as it becomes ever more popular.

## What is Bundlr ?
* Bundlr allows developers to access permanent data storage with instant and guaranteed transaction finality. 
* Bundlr acts as a decentralised caching layer allowing data to be retrievable instantly.

## What is arweave ?
* Arweave is a new type of technology that uses a form of database to store data that cannot be deleted or changed, and uses economics to incentive people to store the data for long periods of time for the first time ever.
* This combination makes either public or private data permanent.

## How we built it
we build it using the previous mentioned .(Polygon,Arweave,Bundlr)

## How to use
* Connect Metamask or WalletConnect (ensure your wallet is connected to Polygon mainnet (chain-137)).
* Provide address of the bundlr network node to connect to and sign the requested message to initiate bundlr network connection.
* Click "Get Matic Balance" to view your current balance with the selected bundlr network node.
* To fund enter an amount (in MATIC) then click fund button.
* To Select image file from your device to upload to the network Click "Upload to Bundlr Network" and sign the requested message to initiate an upload.
* Same you can write and upload text also.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We spend more than 30hours to build this project and finally we got success. we built it in very carefully many errors comes times to times.

## What we learned
we learnt about the bundlr.network and arweave works.

## What's next for Polygon Bundlr Web-app
we are planing to built or modify that website like having all features .
